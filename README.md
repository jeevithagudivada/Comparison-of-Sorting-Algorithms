# Comparison-of-Sorting-Algorithms

The sorting algorithms compared are:

Shell sort	 
Selection sort	     
Quick sort	     
Merge sort	     
Heap sort	     
Bubble sort	   
Insertion sort	   
Bucket sort	   
Radix sort	    
Comb sort	    

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps:

1) Few tens to million inputs which were generated using random number generator. 
2) The inputs were further classified as randomly sorted, almost sorted, descend sorted, all sorted inputs.
3) Graphs were plotted for Runtime v/s Size to determine time complexity.
